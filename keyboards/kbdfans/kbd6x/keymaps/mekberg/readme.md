# General Information

This is more or less a HHKB base layout, but with completely different Fn layers. I don't use most of the HHKB secondary key positions because, honestly, they make no sense to me at all.

Fn key layer is focused mostly on keyboard firmware features as well as some of the necessary alternate functions.

Left Control Hold layer is focused on nav cluster functionality.
